# Canvas

The beautiful piano keyboard for [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications.

Powered by [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). Inspired by the fantastic [VMPK](https://vmpk.sourceforge.io/).

# Inspiration

There are three main requirements of a *useful* piano keyboard rendering:

1. Showing which keys are pressed
1. Communicating note velocity
1. Emulating the physics of weighted keys

Many piano keyboard implementations on the web stop at the first requirement. This implementation satisfies all three. The result is a rendering that actually *feels* like a keyboard.
